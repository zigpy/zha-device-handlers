# ZHA Device Handlers For Home Assistant

ZHA Device Handlers are custom quirks implementations for [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy), the library that provides the [Zigbee](http://www.zigbee.org) support for the [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zha/) component in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). 

Custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers are similar to [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings Classics platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/), meaning they are virtual representation of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms. See [Device Specifics](#Device-Specifics) for details. 

These device handlers currently require the use of a custom [branch](https://github.com/dmulcahey/home-assistant/tree/dm/zha-sensor-playground) of Home Assistant. This will be remediated soon.

# Configuration:

1. Update Home Assistant to 0.85.1 or a later version.

**NOTE:** Some devices will need to be unpaired and repaired in order to see sensor values populate in Home Assistant.

#
# Device Specifics:

### Centralite 

- All supported devices report battery level
- Dimmer Switch publishes events to Home Assistant
- Dimmer Switch temperature sensor is removed because it is non functional

### Osram

- Dimmer Switch publishes events to Home Assistant and reports battery level
- Dimmer Switch temperature sensor is removed because it is non functional

### Xiaomi Aqara

- All supported devices report battery level
- All supported devices report temperature but I am unsure if it is correct or accurate 
- Vibration sensor exposes a binary sensor in Home Assistant that reports current vibration state
- Vibration sensor sends `tilt` and `drop` events to Home Assistant
- Cube sends the following events: `flip (90 and 180 degrees)`, `rotate_left`, `rotate_right`, `knock`, `drop`, `slide` and `shake`
- Motion sensor exposes binary sensors for motion and occupancy.
- Button sends events to Home Assistant

### SmartThings

- tagV4 exposed as a device tracker in Home Assistant and reports battery. The current implementation will use batteries rapidly.
