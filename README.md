# ZHA Device Handlers For Home Assistant

ZHA Device Handlers are custom quirks implementations for [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy), the library that provides the [Zigbee](http://www.zigbee.org) support for the [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zha/) component in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). 

ZHA device handlers bridge the functionality gap created when manufacturers deviate from the ZCL specification, handling deviations and exceptions by parsing custom messages to and from Zigbee devices. Zigbee devices that deviate from or do not fully conform to the standard specifications set by the Zigbee Alliance may require the development of custom ZHA Device Handlers (ZHA custom quirks handler implementation) to for all their functions to work properly with the ZHA component in Home Assistant. 

Custom quirks implementations for zigpy implemented as ZHA Device Handlers are a similar concept to that of [Hub-connected Device Handlers for the SmartThings Classics platform](https://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/device-type-developers-guide/) as well that of [Zigbee-Herdsman Converters / Zigbee-Shepherd Converters as used by Zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_support_new_devices.html), meaning they are virtual representation of a physical device that expose additional functionality that is not provided out-of-the-box by the existing integration between these platforms. See [Device Specifics](#Device-Specifics) for details.

**[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy)** is **[Zigbee protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee)** integration project to implement the **[Zigbee Home Automation](https://www.zigbee.org/)** standard as a Python 3 library. Zigbee Home Automation integration with zigpy allows you to connect one of many off-the-shelf Zigbee adapters using one of the available Zigbee radio library modules compatible with zigpy to control Zigbee based devices. There is currently support for controlling Zigbee device types such as binary sensors (e.g., motion and door sensors), sensors (e.g., temperature sensors), lightbulbs, switches, locks, fans, covers (blinds, marquees, and more). A working implementation of zigpy exist in **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io)** (Python based open source home automation software) as part of its **[ZHA component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/zha/)**
